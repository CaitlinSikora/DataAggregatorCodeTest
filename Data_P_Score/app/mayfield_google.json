The space lacks pretensionâone wall has exposed brick, and the other has a television with the Rangers game playing. The food follows suit: The crisp fried quail, a signature of the menu, is a medley of buttermilk and Old Bay that accentuates the slight gaminess of the bird. Itâs served with a side of honey-bourbon sauce thatâs stronger than some of their cocktails. Grilled octopus is another example of the mix of high and low. A generous cut of the sea beast, poached then grilled for tenderness, is married with white beans and a slice of pork belly that has been cooked in duck confit and then glazed and fried. If thereâs still room on your ribs after the decadent entrÃ©es, the pot du crÃ¨me is a chocolate delight, with hints of orange whipped into a puddinglike consistency.",
